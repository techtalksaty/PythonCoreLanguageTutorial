#Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

#Arithmetic operators
'''
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform 
common mathematical operations

+ Addtion
- Substraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus
** Exponentiation
// Floor Divison 

x=9
y=4

#print(x+y)
#print(x-y)
#print(x*y)
#print(x/y)
#print(x%y)
#print(x**y)
#print(x/y)
#print(x//y)
'''

#Assignment operators
'''
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

num = 10
name = "nameofemployee"
print(num)

num+=1 # num = num + 1
print(num)

num-=1 # num = num - 1
print(num)
'''

#Comparison operators
'''
Comparison operators are used to compare two values
== Equal To
!= No Equal To
>, >= Greater Than and Greater Than Equal To
<, <= Less Than and Less Than Equal To
x=10
y=10
print(x>=y)
'''

#Logical operators
'''
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements

and
or
not
x=7
print(not(x>5 and x<10))
'''

#Identity operators
'''
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, 
but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location
x=["name1","name2"]
y=["age1","age2"]
z=x

#print(x is not y)
#print(x is not z)

name1="name"
name2="name"

print(name1 is name2)

'''


#Membership operators
'''
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object

in
not in

'''


#x = ["apple","banana"]
#print("banana" not in x)

name = "Satyarth rao"
print("R" in name.upper())
